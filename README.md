|Cycle|Properties|Mechanic|
|:---:|:---:|:---|
|Temp|Heat, Cold|High temp increases damage dealt and taken.<br>Low temp increases health given and taken.<br>Works as a resource and stat meter. For every 36 ticks of damage dealt, deal (heat). For every 36 ticks of damage taken, reduce it by (cold).<br>An extra theme would be status conditions/stat changes. Think of weather and Swords Dance from pokemon.|
|Health|Light, Dark|Works off specific health zones (ex: if your **life is between 180 and 360**, deal 50 damage).<br>This cycle cares about controlling your health bar and your opponent's as best as you can.<br>An extra mechanic is knowledge. Dark benefits slightly from keeping possible knowledge hidden, light benefits slightly by gaining/from giving knowledge (This might a seperate 2cycle).|
|Base Stats|Ground, Sea, Plant|Ground refers to how powerful the effect of a card is. Ground cards provide powerful boosts.<br>Sea refers to how many cards you may play before turn end. Sea cards give you more actions.<br>Plant refers to the resource efficiency of a card. Plant cards are lower on overall resource cost, or give you more resources.|
|Permanence|Beast, Tool, Spell|Permanence is how long the card stays in effect.<br>Beasts stay forever until destroyed, tools stay for a limited time/resource frame, spells will move to discard after resolving.<br>(ver2) Beasts stay until destroyed and offer an ability, tools stay until used up and offer an ability, and spells discard on resovle and offer a 1 time ability.|

> # Progression
> Player starts by choosing a character to play with and some modifications to the starting deck.
> 
> The player navigates a fogged dungeon map through each of the three levels.
>
> The rooms are as such
> - Standard enemies through out each room
> - Every forth room cleared has a shop
> - Elites appear at least once each path
> - Special rooms appear throughout the run
> - Unavoidable boss at the end of each level
>
> At the end of each clear, the player may add a card to their deck from a randomized pool and gain some money.
>
> The player gets a monumental boost every boss clear, as well as adding the cards in their deck to their collection, which they may use in a possible pvp format.
>
> The final level has the final boss, which when beaten, unlocks stuff for the player.
>
> At the end of a run, the player gets credits which the can use to buy characters, starting deck mods, etc.

> # Deck building
> The starting deck includes basic offense and defense cards, as well as basic utilities.
>
> The starting inventory (extra deck in yu-gi-oh) depends on the chosen character and currently unlocked deck mods.
