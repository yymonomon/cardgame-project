|Cycle|Properties|Mechanic|
|:---:|:---:|:---|
|Temp|Heat, Cold|Temp is the attack:defence ratio of a beast, where Temp 0 means standard iun both. Temp is often used as a resource in both above and below 0, with a subtheme of status condition and board wide effects.|
|Entropy|Light, Dark|Light and dark are the gain and use of resources, low and high entropy, and the factors of risk and reward. Light beasts and cards tend to give life, reduce chance/chaos, and boost others at their own expense. Dark is the opposite, where they use up life, increase the factor of luck/chaos, and and harm others for big short term boosts.|
|Location|Ground, Sea, Plant|Ground, Sea and Plant embody: body and power, the playstyle of aggro; mind and flexibility, the playstyle of control/adaption; soul and utility, the playstyle of economy.|

> # Rogue Progression
> Player starts by choosing a character to play with and some modifications to the starting deck.
> 
> The player navigates a fogged dungeon map through each of the three levels.
>
> The rooms are as such
> - Standard enemies through out each room
> - Every fourth room cleared has a shop
> - Elites appear at least once each path
> - Special rooms appear throughout the run
> - Unavoidable boss at the end of each level
>
> At the end of each clear, the player may add a card to their deck from a randomized pool and gain some money.
>
> The player gets a monumental boost every boss clear, as well as adding the cards in their deck to their collection, which they may use in a possible pvp format.
>
> The final level has the final boss, which when beaten, unlocks stuff for the player.
>
> At the end of a run, the player gets credits which the can use to buy characters, starting deck mods, etc.

> # Deck building
> The starting deck includes ten basic combat actions, five attack and five defence.
>
> The modifications made cannot increase the deck list size to over 36.
>
> Some ideas of such look like this
> - Flexible: 10 "Combats", 7 "Boosts", 7 "Energizes"
> - Gaurdian: 
> - Brute: 

> # Play
> The player starts by drawing six. They may set any number of those cards to the bottom of the deck to draw that many again. Do this only once.
>
> Turns go as such:
> - You may set any number of cards to gain the mana value and/or gain what is described in the return box.
> - You may play cards by spending the set mana. Any non-instant card uses up one action point, which you have two of.
> - Cards may also be played for a combat value not listed in the type line. A "Heal Action" card with a stat line may combat for free, though it's effect doesn't execute unless specified.
> - Any time you would play a card, for each action point spent to play it, the opponent gets that many action points to respond with.
> - The stack resovles when the opponent cannot or chooses not to play anymore cards, going "first-in: last-out."
> - Once you cannot or choose not to play anymore cards or effects, the turn ends. You draw up to six. The set cards are put to the bottom of your deck in any order you wish.
