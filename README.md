  > # Cycles?

  > Cycles each have a central theme/mechanic.

  > Most of these are basic TCG mechanics, but with an arbitrary name.


|Cycle|Properties|Mechanic|
|:---:|:---:|:---|
|Temp|Heat, Cold|High temp increases damage. Low temp increases block. Works as a resource and stat meter. For every ## ticks of your combats, gain combat relative to temp. Heat and cold are two different resources that start at zero. Changes in pure temp, the stat, will change both in the same way, but changing either does not change temp.|
|Health|Light, Dark|Works off specific health zones (ex: if your **life is between 180 and 360**, deal 50 damage). This cycle cares about controlling your health bar and your opponent's as best as you can. An extra mechanic is knowledge. Dark benefits slightly from keeping possible knowledge hidden, light benefits slightly by gaining/from giving knowledge (This might a seperate 2cycle).|
|Base Stats|Ground, Sea, Plant|Ground refers to how powerful the effect of a card is. Ground cards provide power upfront. Sea refers to how many cards you may play before turn end. Sea cards give you more actions. Plant refers to the resource efficiency of a card. Plant cards give you more resources to work with.|
|Permanence|Beast, Tool, Aura|Permanence is how long the card stays in effect. Beasts stay forever until destroyed, tools stay for a limited resource frame, auras' positive effects stay until a given time. Take note that these are the mechanical names. A 'beast' can be anything that stays in effect until destroyed, not just an animal.|

> # Rogue Progression
> Player starts by choosing a character to play with and some modifications to the starting deck.
> 
> The player navigates a fogged dungeon map through each of the three levels.
>
> The rooms are as such
> - Standard enemies through out each room
> - Every fourth room cleared has a shop
> - Elites appear at least once each path
> - Special rooms appear throughout the run
> - Unavoidable boss at the end of each level
>
> At the end of each clear, the player may add a card to their deck from a randomized pool and gain some money.
>
> The player gets a monumental boost every boss clear, as well as adding the cards in their deck to their collection, which they may use in a possible pvp format.
>
> The final level has the final boss, which when beaten, unlocks stuff for the player.
>
> At the end of a run, the player gets credits which the can use to buy characters, starting deck mods, etc.

> # Deck building
> The starting deck includes ten basic combat actions, five attack and five defence.
>
> The modifications made cannot increase the deck list size to over 36.
>
> Some ideas of such look like this
> - Flexible: Remove five attacks and five blocks. Get 10 "Combats".
> - Gaurdian: Remove two attacks and two defends. Get 3 "Focus Deflects" and 1 "Basic Shield".
> - Barbarian: Remove two attacks and two defends. Get 3 "Focus Strikes" and 1 "Basic Sword".

> # Play
> The player starts by drawing six. They may set any number of those cards to the bottom of the deck to draw that many again. Do this only once.
>
> Turns go as such:
> - You may set any number of cards to gain the mana value and/or gain what is described in the return box.
> - You may play cards by spending the set mana. Any non-instant card uses up one action point, which you have two of.
> - Cards may also be played for a combat value not listed in the type line. A "Heal Action" card with a stat line may combat for free, though it's effect doesn't execute unless specified.
> - Any time you would play a card, for each action point spent to play it, the opponent gets that many action points to respond with.
> - The stack resovles when the opponent cannot or chooses not to play anymore cards, going "first-in: last-out."
> - Once you cannot or choose not to play anymore cards or effects, the turn ends. You draw up to six. The set cards are put to the bottom of your deck in any order you wish.
